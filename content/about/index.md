# About

I'm a master's student in the **Erasmus Mundus CYBERUS** program, specializing in software cybersecurity with a focus on **AI safety and security**. With 4+ years of experience in software development and QA engineering, I'm passionate about advancing AI security through rigorous research and collaboration.

## Research Interests

My current interest is in **trustworthy AI** and ensuring systems are resilient to adversarial attacks. I'm particularly interested in:

- **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Studying poisoning attacks, model robustness, and defense mechanisms.
- **LLM Security**: Exploring alignment, prompt injection, and jailbreaking techniques.
- **Android Penetration Testing**: Ensuring the security of mobile apps.

Through hands-on labs, I've worked on LLM alignment and jailbreaking using greedy coordinate descent optimization (implementing research from "Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models"), and built adversarial-resistant malware classifiers for Android APKs.

## Current Focus

I'm currently deepening my understanding of transformer architectures and mechanistic interpretability through the ARENA course, while also pentesting vulnerable mobile applications. I'm seeking opportunities in **AI safety and security fellowships** to contribute to the development of trustworthy AI systems.

## Experience Highlights

**Open Source Cybersecurity**: I currently work with the AsyncAPI Initiative implementing security best practices including incident response plans, SBOMs, and GitHub security hardening (MFA, CodeQL, protected branches).

**Security Research**: At Grenoble LIG Lab, I validated a privacy-preserving authentication protocol using ProVerif and built a DNSSEC-enabled server prototype with KnotDNS, researching FIDO key integration for enhanced security.

**Software Security Testing**: My QA background across multiple companies (Gotu, Wattics/EnergyCAP, Brrng) developed my adversarial thinking and manual vulnerability assessment skills. I've conducted practical penetration tests (XSS, SQLi, CSRF, XXE, command injection) using Burp Suite and ZAP on DVWA and Juice Shop.

## Technical Background

**AI Security**: Adversarial attacks, model robustness evaluation, LLM security  
**Security Tools**: Burp Suite, Metasploit, Wireshark, Ghidra, ZAP, Frida, ProVerif  
**Development**: Python, Java, C/C++, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
**Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions

## What I'm Looking For

I'm available for a **6-month thesis internship starting February 2026**, ideally focused on adversarial machine learning, model robustness, or trustworthy AI evaluation. I'm also actively seeking AI safety and security fellowships to deepen my research contributions.

## Get in Touch

Feel free to reach out if you're working on AI safety, adversarial ML, or security research—I'm always excited to collaborate and learn from others in the field.
